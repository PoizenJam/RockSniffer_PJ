# RockSniffer
RockSniffer is an application designed for Rocksmith 2014 streamers.
It allows you to display the currently played song and some gameplay stats automatically in realtime.

RockSniffer_PJ is an altered fork of the original RockSniffer with enhanced playtracking status and more robust logging. The fork will track whether a song has been paused or restarted, and outputs times-stamped song-details on song start and end. The intended use case is to enhance stat tracking and video editing capabilities, as the time-stamps can be used to cut individual song videos from larger recordings.

Requires custom [RockSnifferLib](https://github.com/PoizenJam/RockSnifferLib)
